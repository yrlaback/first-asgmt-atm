// BANK ACCOUNT

// REQUIREMENTS
// Create an object called account that has the following properties:
// - accountName, should be the data type string
// this property should contain the name of the account holder

// - balance, should be the data type number
// this property should contain the total amount of the account

// - getBalance, should be a function
// this function should display the total amount of the account to the user

// - deposit, also a function
// this function should be able to deposit money onto the balance of the account

// - withdrawal, also a function
// this function should be able do withdrawal money from the balance of the account

// - getAccountName, function as well
// this function should dispaly the account holders name to the user

// - accountError, same as above function!
// this one is a bit tricky... it's up to you to figure out how or what you should use this for.
// HINT: it's more a thinking poblem than a technical problem :)

// EXTRA: exitAccount, should be a function
// this function should exit the account
// HINT: there are a few different ways to do this, it's up to which way you choose.

// EXTRA = OPTIONAL NOT MANDATORY

// Remember that a function is just a value. And if a function is just a
// value then we can both pass it as a parameter to a function and
// pass it as a property of an object.

// The object should handle all of the functionality (logic)

// The atm() function should be responsible for showing the user interface
// and based on the user input show the right meny choice

// HINT:
// these operators could probably be useful in this assignment:
// && operator
// || operator

// In this assignment you do not have to create any HTML you will only output
// to the console. But you will use prompt instead of just regular console.

// to handle one of the potential errors you can use this built in method isNaN(), this is how you use it:
const variableName = 10;
isNaN(variableName);

// this is the function atm(), I've created some start code for you
function atm() {
  const message = parseFloat(prompt("Display message"));
  // you need to answer the question why we are using parseFloat() method here?
  // you can answer as a comment in your code, and yes you need to some research of your own

  // to show the right output based on the user input you can
  // either use a if/else statement or a switch.
  // Write a comment and motivate your choice
}
